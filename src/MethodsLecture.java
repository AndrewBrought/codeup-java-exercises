//  METHODS
//        A sequence of statements/ block code that performs certain tasks

//                public static void main (String[] args){
//
//        } - has visibility-modifier (public- means other classes can see it), static keyword (optional) means that the method belongs to the class and NOT instances of it, return type of the method- if it doesn't return anything, it will be void, name, takes parameters and has a body
//    There's no reason for main to have a return type because it exists to run our other funcions

//    in JAva we need to specify the type of the arguments

//        public static void HelloWorld(){
//            return "Hello World!";
//        }
//        System.out.println(args);
//            System.out.println(args); //This is an array of strings that's passed into the main method.
//            will always have a main - as long as we run our code in the same class (sometimes we will run code in a different class - but that will take place later)

            //anything that we run is called inside of the main
//            String myGreeting = " Good Day";
//            String cohort = "Olympic";
//            greetCohort(myGreeting, cohort);
//            greetCohort(myGreeting, "Ganymede");
//            greetCohort("Good Morning", "Ganymede");
//            System.out.println(helloWorld());
//        }

//        psvm (String[] args) this is the entry point to our app.  separate classes have one

//     Method Overloading: we can define multiple methods with the same name as long as they have diff. parameter type, parameter order or number of parameters
//    Overloaded methods can call other versions of themselves, use these to provide default values

//  METHOD OVERLOADING

/*

    takes in one String parameter which can replace the item they are
    ordering.

//}
////    Version 3
//    public static void orderFood(String food){
//        System.out.printf("I would like %s please!\n", food);
//    }

//    version 4

        System.out.printf("I would like %s and %s\n", item1, item2);
    }




/*
    TO DO: Overload orderFood again. Create a version that takes in two
    parameters: a String replacing the item being ordered, and an int that
    represents how many of the item they would like to order. Display a new
    message using these arguments.
 */

/*
    TO DO TOGETHER: We'll overload orderFood again. We'll still have two
    parameters in this new version, however they will both be Strings
    representing two different items the customer wants. Let's display a
    new message reflecting the change.

//  RECURSION

//    recursion is great when you don't know the endpoint...we just need to know our specifications and write code that occurs every other time

////        prints out 2, calls count(2 -1)

//         it's confusing because in recursion we because we're terminating the program and then starting back through it again until we get the thing we're looking for...recursion is a great way to see someone's problem solving skills
//        There are different ways to build recursion - test out your method by seeing what's happening
//        3 * getPower(3,4); <- 1st return because this is calling the method, we're not done
//        3 * 3 * getPower(3, 3); <- 2nd return, we're tacking our returns onto eachother
//        3 * 3 * 3 *getPower(3, 2); <- 3rd return
//        3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 <- final result (you keep going until you reach what ever you're calling in the method)
    }

    BONUS: Take a look at the Fibonacci sequence. Write a
    recursive method that accepts an int argument representing the number
    or results printed out following the Fibonacci sequence.



    For example:

    fibonacci(5) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3
    fibonacci(10) would print -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

// HINT: The recursive method should return an int for each number in the series

// HINT: you may need an additional method using a for loop to actually print
// each number

//        orderFood("wings");
////        invokes version three
//        orderFood(3, "Fries");
////        In order for fit to be Method overloading - the arguments have to be different in order for Java to consider it to be a different method
////        invoke version four
