RDBMS - Relational DataBase Management System

Queries:

what items were sold between thurs and fri?
what color is the shirt with sku 1337?

Production server (auto start)
Local Development (manual start/stop)

First check for database error ... is it running?

**YOU are the client

~mysql.server start
~mysql.server stop
~mysql.server status

MySQL CLI

Enter Password: codeup

# To see the MySQL Client commands
mysql> help; //semicolon very important

#To see the MySQL Server commands
mysql> help contents;

output is organized in the command line right out of the box

if table is too big add \G at the end of command to see it vertically

How to quit MySQL CLI:
exit;

Wrapup:
MySQL is a RDBMS
Queries allow for requesting data with multiple criteria
We'll manually start and stop our server

CLI is useful for manipulating data

CREATE USER 'name'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pswd';

SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

GRANT ALL ON mysql.user TO 'name'@'localhost';

UPDATE user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('pswd') WHERE user='name' AND host='localhost';
